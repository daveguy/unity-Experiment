Rift:
interpupillary distance, by default, = 63.5mm. Which is the distance between the ceter of the 2 lenses

Optics are set so the screen appears approximately 1.3m away

In order to prevent eyestrain, objects that you know the user will be fixating their eyes on for an extended period of time (e.g., a menu, an object of interest in the environment) should be rendered between approximately 0.75 and 3.5 meters away.

Use "Reset camera on load" so that the camera is where you've specified it to be, other wise user needs to start in a calibrated position
