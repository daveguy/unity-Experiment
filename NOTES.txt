Rift:
interpupillary distance, by default, = 63.5mm. Which is the distance between the ceter of the 2 lenses

Optics are set so the screen appears approximately 1.3m away

In order to prevent eyestrain, objects that you know the user will be fixating their eyes on for an extended period of time (e.g., a menu, an object of interest in the environment) should be rendered between approximately 0.75 and 3.5 meters away.

Use "Reset camera on load" so that the camera is where you've specified it to be, other wise user needs to start in a calibrated position

OVR CameraRig:
-Set left and right eye anchor cliping planes to 0, otherwie the scenery starts to disapear in a wierd way. 

From Knill, 2003:
Trials began with a 250 ms presentation of the fixation point alone, followed by a pair of slanted surfaces, each displayed for 1000 ms. Between pairs of surfaces, there was a 500 ms delay with a blank screen and new fixation point, presented at the depth of the second stimulus. After both surfaces were presented, the display remained blank until the subject made a response, which initiated the next trial. Except for the initial practice trials in the first session, no feedback was given

From Langer 2016:
correctly, the distance DeltaZ between targets was reduced
by a factor 0.8. When the observer answered incorrectly,
DeltaZ was increased by a factor 2.19.

BLENDER NOTES: Remember to make space UV, smart UV project before displace modify
for size 2 ~1 million verts seems to work, another subdivide starts to have artifacts
for size 3 ~ 279 000 verts, displace strength 0.075. Bake with 0 margin, 16000 max verts

QUESTIONS:
-Do we show a finite, pre-determined number of surfaces. Or have some sort of end condition?

-Do we limit how long users view the surface/have to answer?
