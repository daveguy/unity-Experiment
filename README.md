# unity-Experiment

The C# code is a bit of a mess. The experiment was redefined a couple times and the code was hacked up to try a few different things.
The shaders are very similar, with one key difference. For the matte shader the value \_initCameraPos is set via a script to detach the specularities from the camera.
